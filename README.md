## Introduction

### What is a Network Interface Card (NIC)?

A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component, typically a circuit board or chip, installed on a computer to connect it to a network. NICs provide functionality such as I/O interrupt support, direct memory access (DMA) interfaces, data transmission, network traffic engineering, and partitioning.

[...]

## Types of Network Interface Cards

While the standard NIC is a plastic circuit board that slides into a computer to connect with the motherboard, there are multiple ways this connection can occur:

- Wireless NICs: Provide wireless reception through radio frequency waves.
- Wired NICs: Have input jacks for cables, with Ethernet being a popular wired LAN technology.
- USB NICs: Provide network connections through a device plugged into the USB port.
- Fibre Optics NICs: Expensive and complex NICs used for high-speed support in server computers.

## Ethernet

### What is Ethernet?

Ethernet is a communication protocol created in 1973 that connects computers on a network over a wired connection. It is widely used for Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs).

[...]

## Working of Ethernet

Ethernet follows a simple set of rules governing its basic operation. It uses the OSI model to send signals at the physical layer, transmit data packets at the network layer, and operate as an interface at the TCP/IP layer.

[...]

## Design Phase

### Introduction

The implementation platform chosen is a development board with a Virtex-5 FPGA, specifically the ML507. Using the Xilinx Platform Studio (XPS) tool, the embedded PowerPC 440 processor is configured inside the Virtex-5 FPGA for designing the NIC card.

[...]

### Implementation

The hardware design includes components like PowerPC 440, Block RAM, interrupt controller, RS232, Ethernet MAC, and a DDR_SDRAM memory device. The software design is configured using the Software Development Kit (SDK), and a C-program is written for the server that works on TCP data.

[...]

### Testing and Results

After following the design procedure and utilizing the JTAG for boundary scan through the Impact tool, the implementation of Ethernet on FPGA is successful. Testing involves using the "ping" command to verify IP-level connectivity between the FPGA and a computer.

[...]

## Conclusion

The objective of implementing Ethernet NIC communication on FPGA was successfully achieved. The tools used include Xilinx tools (XPS, SDK, IMPACT) and Tera Term. The project successfully establishes a server-client system between the ML507 development board and a PC via Ethernet.
